<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

<!--
What began as a small hobby to learn C# as a solo beginner started life as a simple WPF utility. Over time, it’s grown into a constantly evolving all‑in‑one desktop app — a place where I experiment, learn, and build features I find useful (and hopefully others will too).
From a handy string generator to a process manager, a savegame manager, and even streaming/downloading series and anime, the app has become a toolbox of everyday utilities. The mix of features might seem unusual, but that’s the fun of it — why not have one place for the tools you need most?
The project is still evolving, and I’m always open to new ideas, feedback, or even wild feature suggestions. If you’ve ever thought, *“Wouldn’t it be cool if an app could…?”* — this might just be the place to make it happen.
